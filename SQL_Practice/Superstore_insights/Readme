📌 Project Overview
This project uses the Superstore dataset to demonstrate end‑to‑end data cleaning, analysis, and visualization.
The workflow combines SQL (SQLite in DBeaver) for data preparation and Python (Jupyter Notebook) for analysis and charts.

⚙️ Steps
- Data Cleaning in SQL
- Standardized text fields (uppercase, trimmed).
- Converted dates from DD/MM/YYYY → YYYY-MM-DD.
- Created a reusable view: superstore_clean.
- Exploratory Analysis
- Monthly sales trends.
- Shipping delay calculations.
- Sales by category and region.
- Visualization in Python
- Line chart: monthly sales trend.
- Bar chart: category sales.
- Histogram: shipping delay distribution.

📊 Tools Used
- SQLite + DBeaver → SQL cleaning and queries
- Python + Pandas + Matplotlib → Analysis and visualization
- Jupyter Notebook → Documentation and storytelling

🚀 How to Run
- Clone this repo.
- Open superstore.db in DBeaver.
- Run superstore_clean_view.sql to create the clean view.
- Open step8_visualization.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
- Run the cells to generate charts.

📈 Sample Insights
- Sales peak in certain months (seasonality).
- Average shipping delay is ~3–5 days.
- Technology category drives the highest revenue.
